    This is a commit title
    This is a commit body message. Which is a long text that describes the commit. I have to think hard to figure out what to write here since this is important for the others to know what has been done in this particular commit.
    
    Few points about this commit:
    * There was a variable called foobar that was declared
    * A keyword var was used to declare the variable foobar
    * The const or the let keywords could have been used instead due it is more advanced
    
    Maybe this commit message is long and descriptive enough to prove a point.
